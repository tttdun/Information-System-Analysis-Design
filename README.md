# Information-System-Analysis-Design
This is the final project that my team of four members implemented for our Information System Analysis Design course in the second semester of our third year at HCMUTE.

The project focuses on analyzing and designing a job search website system using various diagrams. An Activity Diagram will outline the workflow for job seekers and employers. A Use Case Diagram will define the interactions between users and the system's functionalities. The Class Diagram will detail the data structures and relationships within the system. A Sequence Diagram will illustrate the order of operations for job search and application processes. Finally, a State Diagram and Collaborative Diagram will represent the system's state transitions and interactions between components, ensuring comprehensive design and functionality.
